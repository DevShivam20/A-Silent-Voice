              Nagatsuka: Ishida’s overprotective friend and the first person to lose their purple cross. Ironically, the
              two meet as Ishida is the one to step in and stop Nagatsuka from being bullied and losing his bike, though
              Ishida loses his bike in the process. Later on, Nagatsuka retrieves it for him, and his purple cross falls
              from his face — indicating he is someone Ishida is comfortable with.

              Then all of the sudden his mother, oddly calm, asks Ishida why he tried to kill himself. To which Ishida
              responds, in a similar calm manner, “I’ve just been through a lot of stuff. But, what should I say…”
              Ishida’s past and current demons have led him to consider and nearly commit suicide.
